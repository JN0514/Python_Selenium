# Python_Selenium

I automated the task of unfriending all People from my FB. 
This task I did Because, After a long time I visited FB and seen that I have almost thousand connection. 
I shocked and I can't get rid of them one by one. It would be a boring task. 
So, I automated the process with selenium.  
Since, My laptop doesn't have great processor and great network connection, I really had great challenges automating. 
I faced challenges like stale element exception, not interractble exception and no such element exception. 
After, Fixing all the issues, now my code can run in any laptop regardless of your processor and connection.
